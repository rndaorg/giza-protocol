# Giza Protocol: A Blockchain Solution for Fair Labor Compensation in the Real Estate Sector

---

### Abstract

The construction industry, particularly in regions like the Middle East and in fast-developing megacities worldwide, relies heavily on migrant labor. Unfortunately, exploitation and unfair labor practices are prevalent, with many workers trapped in abusive systems that deny them fair wages, basic rights, and dignified working conditions. The Giza Protocol is a blockchain-based solution designed to bring transparency, accountability, and fairness to the compensation of laborers, ensuring that they receive their rightful share from initial property sales and subsequent resales. By leveraging smart contracts, Giza Protocol enforces automatic payments and resale royalties, transforming the real estate sector into a fairer, more sustainable ecosystem for all workers involved.

### Problem

In countries with labor systems like *kafala* in the Middle East and various restrictive labor policies in megacities, construction workers often face conditions that violate basic human rights. These conditions include:

- **Underpayment and Withheld Wages**: Many workers are promised fair wages but are either paid less than agreed or not paid at all.
- **Poor Working Conditions**: Long hours, minimal breaks, and hazardous environments with little concern for worker safety are commonplace.
- **Restricted Mobility and Deceptive Contracts**: Workers are often bound by contracts that limit their movement and freedom, making it difficult to leave abusive situations.
- **Lack of Recourse**: Laborers typically have no effective channels for reporting abuse or securing fair compensation, leading to cycles of exploitation.

The abuse of labor in construction is not only unethical but also unsustainable, undermining the integrity of the real estate sector globally.

### Solution

**Giza Protocol** uses blockchain technology to protect and empower construction workers by implementing a transparent and immutable system for compensation in the real estate sector.

#### Key Features

1. **Smart Contracts for Transparent Payments**:
   - At the core of Giza Protocol are smart contracts that govern the distribution of payments from property sales.
   - During the **initial sale** of a property, a significant portion (e.g., 15-20%) of the sale price is automatically allocated to a **Worker Compensation Pool**. This pool is then distributed to workers based on verified hours and roles recorded on-chain.

2. **Resale Royalties**:
   - Giza Protocol enforces **resale royalties** on all subsequent sales of the property. For up to four resales, a percentage (e.g., 5% decreasing gradually) of the sale price is directed to the original Worker Compensation Pool.
   - This system ensures that workers receive long-term financial benefits and fosters sustained income, especially in high-demand real estate markets.

3. **Worker Identification via Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**:
   - Each worker receives a **non-transferable NFT** representing their role and contribution. These NFTs are tied to the Worker Compensation Pool and ensure they receive their due payments automatically.
   - This NFT serves as proof of contribution, creating a verifiable work history that allows them to benefit from the property’s success over time.

4. **Immutable Record-Keeping and Dispute Resolution**:
   - All transactions and worker contributions are recorded on the blockchain, providing an auditable, tamper-proof history of payments and hours worked.
   - A decentralized dispute mechanism allows workers to report inaccuracies or missing payments transparently, creating accountability and trust in the system.

### Benefits

- **Fair and Automated Payments**: Giza Protocol ensures that workers are paid fairly and on time, removing the risk of withheld wages or deceptive practices.
- **Sustained Income for Workers**: Through resale royalties, workers benefit financially from the long-term success of the properties they helped build, empowering them economically.
- **Transparency and Trust**: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a transparent record of all transactions, fostering trust among workers, contractors, and developers.
- **Scalability for Global Application**: While initially focused on regions with high worker exploitation, Giza Protocol can be scaled and adapted to megacities and countries around the world, setting a new standard in real estate labor practices.

### Conclusion

The Giza Protocol offers a groundbreaking approach to addressing the abuse of construction workers in the real estate industry. By enforcing fair compensation, transparency, and resale royalties, Giza Protocol aims to redefine labor standards, particularly in regions and industries where exploitation is rampant. As an open-source protocol, Giza invites collaboration with NGOs, government bodies, real estate developers, and blockchain communities to create a more equitable future for construction workers worldwide.

**Together, we can build not only resilient structures but also resilient, fair labor practices that uplift the lives of those who make development possible.**
